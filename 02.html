            Benjamin Bratton on Speculative Design, an alternative to mainstream Design that complicates the speculative
            models that underscore our global economy. He suggests design solutions based on longer and shorter
            timescales than regular product lifecycles, and geared toward "users" who may or may not be human. This text
            is based on a transcription of Bratton's remarks at the launch of the Speculative Design undergraduate major
            at the University of California, San Diego, February 10, 2016.

                <p>
                    <span>Speculative Design (SD) understands itself as progressive alternative perspective to
                        mainstream
                        Design culture (and as an alternative to other alternatives as well).</span>1 It knows that
                    "Design" is not
                    some magic way of thinking (involving stick-up notes, sharpies and colored beanbags) that just makes
                    things better by "building trust," "understanding the customer" or "getting a seat at the table" or
                    similar. Design is also the means by which pathological relationships to material culture are made
                    more efficient and more delightful, and we are worse for it.
                    <mark>Some may even conclude that thejob of
                        Design in the 21st century is to undo (much of) the Design of 20th.
                    </mark> It may also be to
                    re-claim and
                    re-launch other frustrated Modern impulses that were dry-docked by century's end, not only designing
                    things -widgets, withdrawn objects, manifest subjectivities, formal forms, etc.- but also designing
                    the relations between them: systems, supply-chains, encounters, obligations, accounting protocols,
                    and so on.
                </p>
                <p>As an alternative perspective, speculation is not ephemeral or disengaged. The prevalence of models
                    for risk patterns, ideal options, and plotted-outcomes underscores that speculation itself is not a
                    supplemental or marginal process. It is less "airy-fairy" than it is nuts and bolts: whether for
                    commodities and equities futures, automated A/B testing, enterprise reinsurance or weather
                    forecasting, the global economy functions by speculative models of the near or long-term future. 2
                    But if so does this disqualify the speculative from the figuring of fundamental alternatives? It
                    does not. Instead of concluding that the future (and futurism per se) is lost it we should
                    commandeer modeling infrastructures for better and more vibrant purposes. <mark> For
                        this,
                        speculative
                        models are rotated from one purpose to another: less to predict what is most likely to happen
                        (deriving value from advance simulation of given outcomes) than to search the space of actual
                        possibility</mark> (even and especially beyond what any of us would conceive otherwise.)3 That
                    is,
                    predictive models are adaptive because they need to be descriptive, but for speculation, models are
                    prescriptive because they need to become normative. Between them we track different uses for
                    contingency, imminence, simulation, navigation, resistance, governmentality, universality,
                    neutrality, etc.4 That is where Design becomes designation.5</p>

                    For obvious reasons it is commonly presumed that there must be an overlap between SD and the more
                    general pursuit of Design Futures, or prototypes from the worlds of tomorrow. Sometimes there are
                    clear alignments, especially for SD projects that address "the future" explicitly as critical
                    subject matter.As I put it elsewhere, in our culture speaking about "the future" is a way of saying
                    things about the present-critical, utopian,projective, pragmatic and/or simply unspeakable
                    things-but too often it is an alibi for saying nothing at all.6 "The future" is that place where
                    skateboards hover and ambient fields of graphical user-interfaces are slightly more elysian; it is a
                    rhetorical sink where half-baked marketing plans usurp the place where actual ideas are supposed to
                    go.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I argue that these are both insufficient responses, and that a detected derangement of familiar
                    spatial and temporal scales is not only not pathological, but may be a precondition for any properly
                    calibrated Design imaginary.Design, as we know, can adhere to small, medium, large or extra-large
                    spatial scales (a single object, a large architecture, an urbanism or a transcontinental system). It
                    can also be trained on very short- or very long-term durations (now, later, much later, afterwards)
                    suited to instantaneous user response, the next launch cycle, the lifecycle of a city, or a geologic
                    trace). We may presume that large scales and long durations are natural matches, but there is no
                    reason to hold fast to this. Very small-scale spatial projects with very long duration ramifications
                    are as likely as very large-scale spatial projects with instantaneous durations, and so we can
                    imagine a combinatory matrix of spatial and temporal scales for design analysis and intervention.
                    <mark>
                        Itis not here and now versus there and then.
                    </mark>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In such a matrix, each temporal scale has its own version of "the future" and some are more
                    interesting to SD than others.There is a social future, with an attendant duration measured in
                    fashion cycles or communal memory of place; a technical future, with its cycles of product SKU
                    turnover and mechanic evolution; a historical future, with trans-generational undulations of friend
                    and enemy, capture and memorialization; and a geologic future, with ripples and rhythms that span
                    far longer than the genomic coherency of any apex species.7 Any affective sense of order by which
                    each of these futural forms may be felt to be in special harmony (geologic future in sync with
                    social future, historical future in sync with technological future, etc.) is surely not an organic
                    state but a broken sophistic illusion.In other words, it takes a special kind of anthropocentric
                    naiveté to fully entertain the idea that making all design "human scale" would be a long-term
                    solution to anything but the most pedestrian problems.8 
                    <mark>The futures that are
                        probably most
                        worth
                        designing are those that exceed human phenomenology's intuitive scales of anatomically-embedded
                        spatial navigation and the temporalities of organism life span.</mark> It is important to
                    mobilize SD on
                    behalf of conditions that are not-yet-existing here and now, and for that we must further shed local
                    social history's mooring privilege. That shift does not take leave of the concrete materiality of
                    Design, quite the contrary. It is only possible by returning our attention to one point of origin
                    for Design: the actual matter of contemporary materialism.

                    <mark>The contemporary project of Design (inclusive of SD) is situated by new materials
                        and material
                        forms.</mark> The emergence of "modern" Design is concurrent with the emergence of the
                    materials, processes
                    and technologies of mass production and distribution: plastics, metals, molding, modeling, printing,
                    stamping, shipping, replicating, stacking, etc. For the Design of what Reyner Banham called "the
                    first machine age," industrial materials allowed for the inexpensive distribution of standardized
                    designs to a mass society: new matter provided for a new materialism. Chemistry as much as economics
                    (probably not so divisible at the end of the day) would drive the anthropology of this era's
                    tangible culture. The periodic table of the elements, innovated by Mendeleev and others, would
                    provide an alphabet for the composition of substance and conjugation of form. In turn, as techniques
                    became schools of thought and designed forms became fixed at certain levels of implementation (type
                    and image, shelter, apparatus, transportation, etc.), modern Design (and Design education) would
                    coalesce around corresponding expertise in graphic design, industrial design, interaction design,
                    architectural design and so on.9
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today we confront another gamut of materials that is potentially just as transformative. From
                    biotechnology to the internet of things to artificial intelligence and robotics to networked
                    additive manufacturing and replication, this material palette provides for the recomposition of the
                    world at scales previously unthinkable, turning living tissue into a plastic medium and imbuing
                    inorganic machines and landscapes with new sorts of practical intelligence. <mark>The
                        social and
                        ecologic
                        project for SD is not only to master an articulation of these new registers of matter, but also
                        conceive a (real) new Materialism</mark>10 that would ratify the organization of society in the
                    image of
                    their still largely-unmapped potentials.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For Design practice, these material systems are of interest to the extent that they allow for the
                    remaking of that world at a more granular level, and for Design theory to the extent that they
                    disenchant and demystify something about our world and our species within that world. As each of
                    these also now occupies some spot on the curve of various hype cycles, from wondertech to everyday
                    appliance, the incantation of their names supposedly signifies futuristic thinking - even when it
                    actually does not. The flowering of their potential for Promethean demystification and refashioning
                    is not automatic; it must be designated. Still, it should go without saying that technological
                    populism and biochemical futurism are not essentially anti-progressive (and for future Wes
                    Andersons, these emerging technologies will also provide for/thematize a pastoral gizmo authentique
                    yet-to-come).

                    The longer-term development of SD and related initiatives (not just at UC San Diego where I teach,
                    but anywhere should formulate its professional, theoretical and pedagogic expertise with this
                    contemporary material palette by putting it in contact with other critical experiments and active

                    program for social and ecological organization may also direct the sometimes overly self-referential
                    Arts and Humanities toward new outward-facing feats of abstraction, imagination and rationalization.

                    Design Theory, but together these examples align the contexts in which Design projects project
                    themselves into the foreseeable future. They identify some of the basic media for Art and Design for
                    the next decade, and in order to find out what they are good for, we need hundreds (thousands) of
                    graduates discerning what the new materials can teach us.13

                    out of making enforceable normative claims-is the most feasible way out and way forward.Again, the
                    ultimate and most lasting value of the new material palette is not (only) in the things we can make
                    with it, but in how it allows/forces us to re-adjudicate fundamental questions about who we are,
                    what we are, where we are, when we are: how we are.

                    The work of Design takes shape in the formulation of the project, a unique rhetorical platform, and
                    through the model, which may describe, idealize or activate the claims of a project. What may give
                    SD some special traction is how it constructs the deliberate and deliberative) ambivalent
                    provisionality between the model and the project. There are more than a few ways it can do this, and
                    I outline some below.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A project is, as the word suggests, a projection of a potential intervention into a situation
                    defined by a certain spatial and temporal range. The project draws on a model of the situation (such
                    as an analytical simulation) and may also result in a model of proposed intervention (such as an
                    architect's model of the built form). Exactly how a model serves as a descriptive or prescriptive
                    simulation may already determine how the project will frame the spatial or temporal terms of its
                    intervention. That is, the project will argue that its breadth of intervention corresponds in some
                    precise way to the breadth of that in which it intervenes. We may have descriptive models, such as
                    diagrams that summarize complex events and relations into synthetic images, foregrounding the most
                    relevant patterns, we hope. Or instead of those retroactive models, we may instead have realtime
                    simulations of those events and processes that provide an indexical dashboard of their status. Or we
                    may have instrumental diagrams that not only model those events and relations, but which when
                    manipulated by a designer or user, also directly affect them. Graphical user interfaces are an
                    example of this sort of model. Indeed, the history of Design is not only one in which new
                    technologies allow for new forms to be made, but one in which new technologies allow for new kinds
                    of models about what is to be made. These include "Big Data" and similar ways that we automate live
                    models of patterns we could not otherwise deduce.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The modern era of Design innovated models not only for understanding systems but also for
                    understanding the users of those systems. From the ancestral Vitruvian Man to Henry Dreyfuss's "Joe
                    and Josephine" millions of use-case personas have stood in for larger consumer publics in the
                    specification of designed solutions to standardized psychological requirements. Beyond ergonomic
                    requirements, Cognitive Science-influenced Design would also reconstruct the mental models with
                    which users understand and interact with complex designed systems. One of the chief epistemological
                    and methodological complexities of Design models is how easily one kind of model (descriptive,
                    diagrammatic, diagnostic, normative) can be transposed into the purposes of another (projective,
                    instrumental, managerial, aspirational). This is no less true for data-driven Economic models than
                    it is for concept-driven Speculative models, though the latter may have a more resilient tolerance
                    for the ambiguities that those shifts introduce.14
                </p>
                <p>
                    In relation to such models (and models of models), the agency of the project within SD (and
                    especially within SD education) deserves careful attention, and so the remainder of my remarks will
                    hopefully provide some useful points for further debate.

                    Bruce Sterling's working definition of "Design Fiction" as "the deliberate use of diegetic
                    prototypes to suspend disbelief about change" remains a serviceable one for SD, but is also (true to
                    his point) an incomplete assignment. What comes after the suspension, and what homology is there
                    between the prototype and the change? The less certain the link the better the insight, as it may
                    turn out. The impetus to provoke disenchantment with the commonsensical is well-advised. But at the
                    same time, we should be cautious that Design in this vein does not lapse into a merely
                    "prefigurative" material politics, whereby its function becomes to offer up fetishistic ideal forms
                    of some community-to-come, and for which the purification of means pre-occupies and delays the
                    enforcement of its ends. 15The relation that different SD practices may have to "the real," and to
                    enchantment or disenchantment as a strategy, can be quite varied but across that spectrum there is
                    an allegiance to keeping the correspondence between the prototype and the outcome, the cause and
                    effect, an open and winding path-not a straight line. Sometimes you build a kite and it evolves into

                    probably par for all modernities, our problem is not just with things like nanotechnology and global
                    migration flows. It is also with simple things like sugar, and how our hunter-gatherer propensity
                    for glucose, sucrose and fructose and our sentimental neo-Creationist ideas about food, have built
                    the chemical supply-chain of cuisine as a diabetes megastructure. A cup of demystification beats a

                    Our current thinking is what makes these technologies possible and is what prevents them from fully
                    reaching their capacities for meaningful innovation.17 Accordingly, maximizing institutional
                    investment in engineering capacity while minimizing investment in the conceptual and critical
                    capacity that would sustain implementation is an irrational policy. Universities take heed: the
                    efficient, illuminated path is to balance means and vision. Sustained and diverse investment in
                    conceptually-courageous, culturally-informed, norm-making Design, Art and Humanities is necessary to
                    realize the social value of investments in emerging technology. That said, it is also true that
                    sometimes romantic and reactionary posturing (and general technical ignorance) in some such
                    discourses and departments (present company excluded of course!) makes a course correction more
                    difficult than it should be.

                    emerging technologies are interesting to Design theory to the extent that they demystify and
                    disclose something about our world and our species (and others) within it. That is, our
                    contemplation and configuration of possible uses not only provides new means to do What we already
                    understand must be done, but also may de-authorize our secular superstitions about who should do
                    what with whom. That can mean different things to different people, and so much the better.

                    Any sufficiently powerful/ efficacious technology is simultaneously both good and bad (not or: and).
                    So, pick your metaphor, Greek or germline. Emerging technologies are Pharmakoi: they are remedies
                    and poisons. Any plan for them, or commentary on them, that evangelizes their positive or negative
                    potential without articulating the inverse is incomplete and/or dishonest. Or if you like, emerging
                    technologies are like stem cells; they could become this or they could become that, and which it
                    will be is undecided but still decidable. Again, it is unwise to announce that their early
                    manifestations (good or bad) represent their essential character and potential. We simply don't know
                    what they are good for yet, and so the search space of possibilities must be kept open for as long
                    as possible (see above on balanced investment in means and conceptualization).

                    Even in the same research institution, sometimes the research that an Artist or Designer conducts
                    may be essentially the same as what a Scientist may attempt, but one experiment can happen and the
                    other cannot. The disciplinary permissions are different, and so the arbitrage of leeway is a space

                    Milgram's Obedience to Authority Experiment by Rod Dickinson in Glasgow's CCA Gallery, and the
                    likelihood that any Human Test Subjects research review committee would approve any new follow-on
                    studies by the Psychology faculty. Recently, I heard Jacob Applebaum discussing the Autonomy Cube, a
                    collaboration with Trevor Paglen, and its installation in various Art galleries and museums, where
                    this Tor meta-object, anonymizing invisible data packets in our immediate midst, drew the scorn of
                    local security officials. Outside the gallery, the device may have been confiscated or otherwise
                    intercepted, but inside the gallery -where mimesis takes precedence- the sculpture is granted a kind
                    of asylum and immunity from prosecution. Karolina Sobecka builds cloud-making and -tracking
                    machines, collaborating informally and unofficially with climate researchers at Scripps Institute of

                    geoengineering research by scientists, but her projects are possible if conducted as "only" Art. SD
                    is a zone where the tactical exceptions to norms can be granted and where, thereby, new norms are

                    For students, particularly younger and inexperienced students, the conventions of mainstream Design
                    culture are sometimes an obstacle to the formulation of original research and a provocative project.
                    Unworkable pitches for TechCrunch ("It's Tinder meets AirBnB for Oculus Rift") or an idealistic
                    non-profit ("biofuel-powered hackathons for mindfulness") are the default idioms.

                    I counsel students that their projects should seek to span two balances. For the first, we are
                    uncertain whether the project is "real" (did it happen, is it really being proposed to happen, are
                    these prototypes functional, are those images composites, etc.?) It may be clear to us, the
                    viewers/respondents/users of the work, that this uncertainty is deliberate and that our
                    interpretation depends on thinking it through. Ideally, if as we examine the work more carefully we
                    are yet even less sure how "real" the work is (even unsure of the designer's own intentions), then
                    it is possible that instructive fault-lines between common sense and emergent reason can be
                    discerned.19

                <p>
                    The second balance to be pursued is not ontological, but ethical and programmatic. If we are taken
                    aback by the strength of the design proposal, and are certain that should this project be realized
                    it would have dramatic, significant effect, but are also uncertain whether doing so would be the
                    best thing or the worst thing in the world (and more unsure the more we consider the project), then
                    it is more likely that there are original and serious insights be gleaned from the research.

                    Ambiguity, abstraction and ambivalence are signals of successful Design Research, and the best SD
                    projects position us between pro and con interpretations: is this ethical and/or unethical, is this
                    remedy and/or poison? If we already know that such thing would be one or the other, then the project
                    may not suggest an interesting direction for ongoing experimentation. We know the outcome in
                    advance. This is not to say that Design practice as a whole should not solve clear problems in
                    clever ways (we are thankful for usable tools and interfaces that match doxic mental models and for
                    the effects of scale that they provide), but the SD research program has a specific interest and
                    allegiance to ambiguity not just as a means but as an end in and of itself.

                    Among my favorite well-known SD briefs was one written by the United States Department of Energy's
                    Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management's Yucca Mountain Project (YMP). Proposals were
                    solicited for a signage system that would warn-off curious future excavations from accidentally
                    unearthing radioactive nuclear waste to be buried there in the desert. "Engineers, archaeologists,
                    anthropologists, and linguists were convened to design effective warning structures capable of
                    lasting 10,000 years ... Using archeological sites as 'historical analogues."20

                <p>
                    The brief is interesting for how it simultaneously demands both open speculation as to who/what
                    would be reading the proposed semiotics and for how strongly the answers must be tethered to the
                    very real dangers. The temporal scale of the proposed intervention (over 130 average human
                    generations) is what demands super-speculative hyper-utilitarianism. It invites proposals that are
                    genuinely uncanny because they are absolutely functional.

                <p>
                    I believe that we would be better served by similar briefs for other design problems. If we were to
                    use 10,000 years to situate the successful design of other important domains (multigenerational
                    housing, sovereign geographies, gender hacks, human-artificial intelligence interaction,
                    transnational urbanism, egalitarian synthetic biology, or interspecies communication, etc.), I am
                    confident that the design solutions (for us to grow into over time) would be both more imaginative
                    and more functional than those prepared for yearly, decadal or average human organism lifespan
                    durations.

                    Furthermore, considering our interest in developing pedagogies that impart a more accurate
                    understanding of where and when we actually are-based, on geological time and astrophysical
                    place-then a pedagogy of "long circuits" would not just be one in which the speed of information
                    technology is slowed to the pace of phenomenal contemplation (per Bernard Stiegler) but rather one
                    in which technical contemplation-composition is extended to the actual duration of its chemical and
                    ecological reverberations.21

                <p><mark>To conclude: What is called “human-centered design” (sometimes interchangeable
                        with
                        “User-Centered
                        Design”)</mark> is not only not the solution, it is quite often the problem. Insofar they both
                    de-center
                    and de-privilege the human within their scenarios, there are points of alignment between the
                    impulses of SD (as I’ve described it) and some of the formulas of Speculative Realism (but not
                    others).22 The interest, to be clear, is not to eliminate (or to claim to eliminate) human
                    sentience, sapience and affect from these rich dramas, but to conceptualize the world and to compose
                    with it according to models that locate human specificity in a more deliberately dispassionate
                    position. The designable transformation of our position then becomes that much more
                    accessible.23 That is, one lesson we should take from the Anthropocenic predicament is that
                    Anthropocentrism —that the world is notionally here for us— finds justification in forms of Humanism
                    for which the human experience of human experience (of the world or of just itself) offers more
                    profound truths than a materialism for which we are but one (albeit lovely) genre of sentient
                    matter.</p>
                <p>Recently, I spoke with a colleague in the Art world involved in an ongoing project on theorizing the
                    Anthropocene and was a bit alarmed by how much the inverse conclusion was taken for granted. In
                    short, he repeated to me the thesis, as if obvious, that the root cause of this ethical-ecological
                    malaise is opaque, mystical planetary hyperobjects and withdrawn, conspiratorial hyperprocesses, and
                    therefore the work of political Art and Design is to re-render these sprawling systems at a
                    phenomenologically-intuitive human scale.24 The purpose of doing so, he said, is not only so that
                    people can understand them in regular terms but so that their abominably inhuman scope can be
                    reformed: we can “heal” the Anthropocenic predicament by de-scaling its unnatural complexities back
                    to a graspable, proximate organic norm. This approach is symmetrically opposite of what is to be
                    done. With briefs like the Yucca Mountain signage in mind, we can say if SD can help to outline
                    uncannily practical paths out of the Anthropocene, it is absolutely not because vast, impersonal
                    temporal and spatial scales of global systems are brought to heel and drawn down to intuitive
                    neurological and emotional comfort-zones. <mark>To think and design in other ways and
                        at other
                        scales is
                        not only theoretically more defensible; it is now a practical necessity.</mark> The weaving of
                    long
                    circuits should head in the opposite direction: Design scaled to the scope of the real, not reality
                    downsampled toward the digestible.</p>
