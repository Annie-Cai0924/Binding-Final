                    The term <mark>“critical design”

                    </mark> has been gaining currency in design circles for several
                    years, and in
                    2007, it went public in the titles of three imaginative exhibitions. Two of these shows, in the U.K.
                    and Belgium, dealt with three-dimensional design. The exhibition that concerns me here was the first
                    I know of to apply the term to graphic design.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Forms of Inquiry: The Architecture of Critical Graphic Design” took place at the Architectural
                    Association in London, a private school with a huge international reputation (former students
                    include Rem Koolhaas, Richard Rogers, and Zaha Hadid). The exhibition’s two young curators were Mark
                    Owens, an American designer, writer, and filmmaker, and the AA’s art director, Zak Kyes, a
                    Swiss-American.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    <mark>As a term, “critical design” has plenty going for it: It sounds sharp, analytical, engaged,
                        and
                        urgent. It also raises some questions, since its existence as a special category implies that
                        regular design is, by contrast, not critical.</mark> Our view of this does, of course, depend on
                    what we
                    expect design to be doing. But if the implicit aim is simply to help clients sell more doodads, then
                    all that matters is how effectively design achieves this goal. Design that lacks critical awareness
                    of the situations in which it operates can only be a compromised activity. Critical design suggests
                    aims and methods that are different in some fundamental ways from the norm.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Even if we allow that most design is not in any deep sense critical, it surely can’t be the case
                    that there has never been any critical design until now. Yet proponents of “critical graphic design”
                    tend to present it as though it had arrived fully formed with no precedents. In a section of
                    the Forms of Inquiry book devoted to modes of production, Kyes and Owens ask:
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="pading-p">
                    But what happens when the designer assumes the role of editor, publisher, and distributor outside
                    the constraints of the … client/designer relationship? Taking such a position challenges the …
                    service-based model of graphic design, reliant as it is on supplied content, external requests, and
                    the division of work-flow into discrete specialisations.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    These are good points, and a few graphic designers have been making them with great self-awareness
                    and no little controversy for 20 years, if not longer. To give just one example, Emigre was a
                    self-initiated venture that debated such questions at length while demonstrating by its own
                    independent example exactly what it was talking about.

            <div class="content">
                <p>In the 1990s, these critical discussions were usually conducted under the banner of “the
                    designer as author,” and sometimes, especially in the Netherlands, “the designer as editor,” but the
                    similarities to contemporary critical design are clear enough.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In a discussion about critical design exhibitions on Design Observer, design educator Steven
                    McCarthy, co-organizer of the 1996 exhibition “Designer as Author: Voices and Visions,” expressed
                    concern that the initial post by design critic Alice Twemlow didn’t “acknowledge that much of the
                    philosophical foundation of ‘critical design’ resides in the theories of graphic design authorship
                    advanced over ten years ago.” This omission certainly reflected the self-positioning of many of the
                    critical designers, who seem to want to distance themselves from these earlier debates.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In reality, some of the older graphic designers associated with critical design and featured in
                    “Forms of Inquiry”—Paul Elliman, Armand Mevis and Linda van Deursen, and Stuart Bailey of Dexter
                    Sinister and Dot Dot Dot magazine—were in the early stages of their careers as the concept of the
                    designer as author took hold. <mark>No well-informed designer could have failed to notice these
                        debates—Bailey even contributed to Emigre.</mark></p>
                <br>
                <p>At CalArts, where Kyes earned a BFA, instructors such as Lorraine Wild (who taught design history),
                    Louise Sandhaus, and Gail Swanlund were all associated with Emigre, and Michael Worthington was
                    invited by Kyes and Owens to participate in “Forms of Inquiry.” Jeffery Keedy and Ed Fella, central
                    to the authorship discussion, were also influential figures at the school.</p>
                <br>
                <p>More than anything, the reluctance to acknowledge recent precedents is probably just a new
                    generation’s desire to establish its own identity, combined with a cyclic swing in graphic taste.
                    Where the 1990s was a decade of thickly encrusted visual overload, the critical designers can’t get
                    enough don’t-sweat-it typography and fastidious conceptual restraint. Their shyness about origins
                    does seem shortsighted, though; it’s just the latest example of graphic design’s endemic lack of
                    faith in its own worthiness.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Art and architecture, conspicuous sources of envy among the new critical designers—many of their
                    projects are for artists—would never make this mistake. <mark> Critical design can only gain from an
                        explicit acceptance and conscious interrogation of its own evolving history.</mark></p>
                <br>
                <p>There are, nevertheless, some differences of emphasis. While the new critical designers take their
                    own agency for granted, just as post-feminists took the feminists’ hard-won gains for granted, they
                    are less concerned with what Owens, writing in Dot Dot Dot, calls the “market value of ‘the designer
                    as author.’” They tend, at least in graphic terms, to be humbler than their predecessors. They
                    stress their role as participants and collaborators, proclaim the value of process over final
                    product, and rethink the means of distribution, favoring the idea of “just in time” production—a
                    manufacturing term—to avoid needless waste.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>“In my graphic design practice, leaving things as found, or even taking things away, can be just as
                    valid a design decision as making something new,” says James Goggin. (It’s also worth noting how
                    tight-knit this group of like-minded colleagues appears to be. As one of the selectors for
                    Phaidon’s Area 2 compendium, Goggin chose to include Dexter Sinister, Owens, and Will Holder, who
                    was also in “Forms of Inquiry.”)</p>

                <p>To make critical design’s recent history and usage more complicated for graphic designers, the term
                    was first applied to industrial design. Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby devote a section to it in their
                    2001 book Design Noir, and anyone using it now should consult their discussion. “Critical design, or
                    design that asks carefully crafted questions and makes us think, is just as difficult and just as
                    important as design that solves problems or finds answers,” write Dunne and Raby. “Its purpose is to
                    stimulate discussion and debate amongst designers, industry, and the public. … <mark>Critical design
                        takes
                        as its medium social, psychological, cultural, technical, and economic values in an effort to
                        push
                        the limits of lived experience, not the medium.”</mark>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Dunne and Raby are absolutely clear about the political nature of critical design. Its task, as they
                    see it, based on their own practice, is to develop design proposals in the form of models,
                    publications, and exhibitions that challenge conventional values. They caution that designers must
                    avoid the pitfalls of earlier attempts at critical design and develop strategies that link it to
                    everyday experience and engage the viewer.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Kyes and Owens don’t mention Dunne and Raby in their Forms of Inquiry book, but the most carefully
                    thought-out, fully realized and convincing example of critical design they present is strikingly
                    close to Dunne and Raby’s precepts. Metahaven, headed by Daniel van der Velden, Vinca Kruk, and Gon
                    Zifroni in Amsterdam and Brussels, is a kind of graphic design think tank that uses models,
                    proposals, essays, and lectures to discover how design might facilitate new forms of critical
                    investigation.</p>
                <br>
                <p>One Metahaven project focused on the identity of the Principality of Sealand, a former World War II
                    antiaircraft tower off the coast of Britain, which became a “micro-nation” in 1967 when a
                    broadcaster declared it a sovereign state. The firm’s contribution to “Forms of Inquiry” dealt with
                    the destruction of 7 World Trade Center during the afternoon of the September 11 attacks. The
                    building’s collapse was announced by BBC television 26 minutes before it happened, an event that
                    became the focus of conspiracy theories. Metahaven’s graphic report for the exhibition was a
                    double-sided poster carrying a dense grid of data about the building.</p>
                <br>
                <p>“We as designers want to step out of the ideological deadlock offered by current politics,” they
                    write, “and explore the possibilities of design re-engaged with the imagination and the political.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p><mark>In their democratic view, designers are, first of all, citizens.

                </mark> This is energizing
                    talk, but again,
                    the idea of the “citizen designer” has a history that shouldn’t be forgotten. If critical graphic
                    design is more than an aloof intellectual pose, it should spend less time hanging out with artists,
                    turn its intelligence outward, and communicate with the public about issues and ideas that matter
                    now.</p>
