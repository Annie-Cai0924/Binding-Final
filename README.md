Challenges that I had and learned from：
The menu page, checkbox I think it's a little complicated for me，
Use pseu/do-elements (like colon before and colon after) to realize the effect，
And State selectors such as colon checked make the checkbox's style change dy/na/mically.

What I can improve on: 
As for what i can improve on for my project is
In the process of writing css, 
I often modify one code but change another, 
so my css is very messy , and I often can't find the one I really want to modify, 
so my next step is to make my css clean and methodical.
And Solve the problem of subtitle on mobile phone size.
